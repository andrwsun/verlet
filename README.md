Verlet Integration Fabric Simulator
not optimized at all LMAO. 

Things I wanted to put into this but was not good enough at coding:
 1. Quadtree optimization
 2. Different anchor placements:
    - User drawn curves turn into anchor points.
    - Drawn Polygons fill up as fabric (kind of like a spiderweb).
 3. Forces such as wind
 4. Colours!

If you add improvments I would LOVE to see them, so pleaaase contact me on instagram @as.ws__ or andrews.sas12@gmail.com.
